 *** String Processing Algorithms ***

Contents of the archive:

1) algo.h - this file contains functions that implement the solution to the string processing problem using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and the Edit Distance algorithm based on the Levenshtein distance.

2) KMP.cpp - this file reads the path to an input test from stdin and applies the KMP algorithm, implemented in algo.h . It also displays the result in an out folder.

3) Edit.cpp - this file reads the path to an input test from stdin and applies the Edit Distance algorithm, implemented in algo.h . It also displays the result in an out folder.

4) Makefile - has rules for building and executing the program, but also contains a clean rule for the object file.

5) algo.o - object file created upon calling the Makefile that contains the implementations of the functions defined in algo.h .

6) in - folder that contains 10 input tests that work on both algorithms implemented in algo.h .

7) out - this folder displays the results of either KMP or Edit Distance, for a given input test.

8) ref_KMP - this folder contains all the correct outputs for all the tests running the KMP algorithm.

9) ref_EditDistance - this folder contains all the correct outputs for all the tests running the Edit Distance algorithm.


For the implementation of the chosen algorithms, parts of code were directly taken from Geeks for Geeks and are available here:
